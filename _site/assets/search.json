The team will develop an early warning system for the Texas-Mexico border region, but it will be extended to soil-borne diseases as well as other geographies.\n\n\n\n\nBack\n\n",

We work on understanding the dynamics of the relationship between emerging infectious diseases and climate change, in order to identify and predict health risks. Our team comprises of flood modelers, infectious disease experts, and epidemiologists. Community engagement will be used to incorporate local issues with flooding and diseases into our models.\n\nA key aim of our project is to develop an openly accessible computational tool that could be used by non-expert users, such as researchers and health professionals, and allow them to use available climate inputs and epidemiological information to facilitate analysis, prediction and comprehensive visualization of data.\n\nMeet Our Team\n\n",
